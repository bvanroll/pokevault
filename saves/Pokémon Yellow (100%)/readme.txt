Instructions

1. Pick the save file which you want.
2. Put it in the directory (folder) which the emulator reads it from, which could be...
											- the directory of the ROM
											- subsidiary of the emulator (one of the folders where the emulator executable is located)
											- a custom location ( check the directory settings of the emulator (usually called native or battery saves) )

3. Make sure the (.sav) file matches the name of the ROM! (rename it if you have to)
4. Enjoy!
